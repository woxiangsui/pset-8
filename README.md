## Feature Requests

Now that you have a functional tic-tac-toe app, it's time to make it your own. Take a look at the list of feature requests below. Your job is to choose some of these feature requests and integrate them into your app.

- Allow players to keep score (i.e., how many games has each player won).
- Allow players to determine who goes first (instead of X always going first).
- Style your app so that it is responsive to mobile users (i.e., it should be optimized to work well on your phone or tablet).
- Allow a human player to play against a better-than-random computer player.

If you choose the fourth feature request (i.e., computer players), then you don't need to choose any other feature requests to implememnt. Otherwise, you need to choose **two** feature requests.

If you submit your problem set at midnight (i.e., February 10, 2020, at 12:00am), it is considered **late**!
